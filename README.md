# ASD-project

This repository is meant to store the necessary swift files and data for the ASD project.

If you make any edits to any of the files, please ensure you change the version number to avoid confusion:

Eg: v1.0-Ca (version 1, made by Callum)
    v1.4-Co (version 1.4 made by Coen)
    v1.7-J (version 1.7 made by Jonathan)

Please note that any design documents are not to be put in this repository.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a "Projects" tab above all the files which we can use to add any plans to them. If you are coming up with anything, please post your plans there.

Also, there is a special column for special stuff which would also in my opinion come in handy. ;)
